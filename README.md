# Sodor Island 3D 2006 (March 2023)
![](https://github.com/Zeldaboy14/SI3D-2006/blob/main/docs/img/banners/header.jpg?raw=true)

A complete archive of SI3D 2006 as it stood in March 2023, with some tweak to fit with the 2009 archive. 
At the current second, not everything has been re-linked from the old 2006 pages, but in due time, will be.
